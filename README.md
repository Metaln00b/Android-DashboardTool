# DashboardTool
- I would like to use this tool to send data via USB or Bluetooth.
- A background service should send the data at intervals.
- The service should be startable and stoppable.
- The variables and their values are currently in the MainActivity and I have to transfer them to the service elsewhere.
- This project is currently work in progress.
